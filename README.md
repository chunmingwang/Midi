MIDI stands for "Musical Instrument Digital Interface." It is a digital communication protocol used to transmit music information between musical devices such as keyboards, synthesizers, and computers. MIDI does not transmit audio signals, but rather musical instructions such as notes, volume, and timbre. This allows different brands and types of musical devices to communicate and collaborate, such as converting performance on a keyboard into notes in music software on a computer. MIDI also allows for controlling various parameters of musical devices such as volume, timbre, reverb, etc. MIDI has become one of the most common standards in the music industry and is widely used for recording, composing, and playing music.
